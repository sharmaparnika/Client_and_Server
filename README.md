# Client_and_Server

Aim: Implement a Socket Programming for Client â€“ Server model 

## ALGORITHM: 

### SERVER:

    STEP 1: Start the program. 
    
    STEP 2: Declare the variables and structure for the socket. 
    
    STEP 3: The socket is binded at the specified port.
    
    STEP 4: Using the object the port and address are declared. 
    
    STEP 5: The listen and accept functions are executed. 
    
    STEP 6: If the binding is successful it waits for client request. 
    
    STEP 7: Execute the client program. 

### CLIENT:

    STEP 1: Start the program. 
    
    STEP2: Declare the variables and structure. 
    
    STEP 3: Socket us created and connect function is executed. 
    
    STEP 4: If the connection is successful then server sends the message. 
    
    STEP 5: The date and time is printed at the client side. 
    
    STEP 6: Stop the program.
